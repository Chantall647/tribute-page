  <figcaption id="img-caption"> As a medical doctor and a writer, Dr. Sacks achieved a level of popular renown rare among scientists. More than a million copies of his books are in print in the United States, his work was adapted for film and stage, and he received about 10,000 letters a year. (“I invariably reply to people under 10, over 90 or in prison,” he once said.)</figcaption><br><br>

    <p class="font"> Here's a timeline of Dr. Oliver Sacks's life:</p>
    <div id="content">
    <div id="tribute-info">
    <ul>
      <li> 1933 - Born in Cricklewood, London, England.</li> <br>
      <li> 1939 - When Sacks was six years old, he and his older brother Michael were evacuated from London to escape the Blitz, and sent to a boarding school in the Midlands where he remained until 1943. </li><br>
      <li> 1951 - He entered The Queen's College, Oxford, obtaining a BA degree in physiology and biology in 1956. </li><br>
      <li> 1958 - He received an MA degree and BM BCh degree.</li><br>
      <li> 1960 - He visited the Montreal Neurological Institute and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), telling them that he wanted to be a pilot. After some interviews and checking his background, they told him he would be best in medical research. But as he kept making mistakes, like losing data of several months of research, destroying irreplaceable slides and losing biological samples, his supervisors had second thoughts about him.[20] Dr. Taylor, the head medical officer, told him, "You are clearly talented and we would love to have you, but I am not sure about your motives for joining." He was told to travel for a few months and reconsider.</li><br>
      <li> 1966 - 2007 - Sacks served as an instructor and later clinical professor of neurology at Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and also held an appointment at the New York University School of Medicine from 1992 to 2007. In July 2007 he joined the faculty of Columbia University Medical Center as a professor of neurology and psychiatry. At the same time he was appointed Columbia University's first "Columbia University Artist" at the university's Morningside Heights campus, recognising the role of his work in bridging the arts and sciences. He was also a visiting professor at the University of Warwick in the UK.</li><br>
      <li> 2012 - Sacks's book Hallucinations was published. In it he examined why ordinary people can sometimes experience hallucinations and challenged the stigma associated with the word. He explained: "Hallucinations don't belong wholly to the insane. Much more commonly, they are linked to sensory deprivation, intoxication, illness or injury." He also considers the less well known Charles Bonnet syndrome, sometimes found in people who have lost their eyesight. The book was described by Entertainment Weekly as: "Elegant... An absorbing plunge into a mystery of the mind."</li><br>
      <li> 2015 - Oliver Sacks, a world-renowned neurologist and author, died on Sunday Aug. 30 at the age of 82.</li><br>
      <li> FYI - Awakenings is a 1990 American drama film based on Oliver Sacks's 1973 memoir of the same title. It tells the story of a fictional character, neurologist Dr. Malcolm Sayer, who is based on Sacks and played by Robin Williams. In 1969, he discovered beneficial effects of the drug L-Dopa. He administers it to catatonic patients who had survived the 1917–28 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica. Leonard Lowe (played by Robert de Niro) and the rest of the patients are awakened after decades and have to deal with a new life in a new time. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards.</li>
